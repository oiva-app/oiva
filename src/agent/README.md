Welcome to your new [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/) project! We're excited to see what you'll build.

## Getting Started

Start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Configure the LLM provider API keys required by the agent model router IDs in
your `.env` file. Mastra reads provider-standard names automatically, such as
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for `openai/...`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for `anthropic/...`, and
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` for `google/...`.

Open [http://localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) in your browser to access [Mastra Studio](https://mastra.ai/docs/studio/overview). It provides an interactive UI for building and testing your agents, along with a REST API that exposes your Mastra application as a local service. This lets you start building without worrying about integration right away.

You can start editing files inside the `src/mastra` directory. The development server will automatically reload whenever you make changes.

## Deploy to the Mastra platform

The [Mastra platform](https://projects.mastra.ai) provides two products for deploying and managing AI applications built with the Mastra framework:

- **Studio**: A hosted visual environment for testing agents, running workflows, and inspecting traces
- **Server**: A production deployment target that runs your Mastra application as an API server
